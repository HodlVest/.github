### 🔗 Decentralized ROSCA + AI-Powered Savings on the Internet Computer

---

## 🌍 Vision

HodlVest empowers communities to build wealth through decentralized, trustless group savings — transforming traditional ROSCA systems into intelligent, borderless financial tools. We’re reimagining community finance by combining blockchain transparency with AI precision, making savings smarter, fairer, and more accessible for everyone.

---

## 💡 The Problem

Traditional savings groups (like ROSCAs, ajo, or susu) are powerful community tools — but they're limited by:

- Lack of transparency and trust
- Risk of fraud or mismanagement
- No automation or scalability
- Local-only access, disconnected from global finance

---

## 🧠 The Solution

HodlVest digitizes and decentralizes ROSCA cycles on the **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**, using **smart contracts** to handle fund pooling, turn-taking, and payouts — all without a central admin.

We integrate **AI agents** to enhance:

- **Cycle management & scheduling**
- **Fraud detection**
- **Member scoring/reputation**
- **Savings recommendations**

This unlocks autonomous, intelligent, and truly inclusive savings infrastructure — accessible from anywhere, without banks or middlemen.

## 🔧 Core Features

- 🔐 **Trustless ROSCA smart contracts** (ICP canisters)
- 🤖 **AI-powered agent layer** for intelligent cycle coordination
- 🌐 **Global accessibility** with borderless crypto payments
- 👥 **Reputation system** to build social trust on-chain
- 💰 **Yield opportunities** for long-term savers (HODL incentive layer coming soon)

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- **Internet Computer Protocol (ICP)**
- **Motoko / Rust canisters**
- **AI modules (Python-based or canister-integrated)**
- **Frontend (React / Vue, integrated with Internet Identity)**

---

## 🎯 Use Cases

- Village and urban ROSCA groups moving to Web3

## 🌱 Roadmap (Post-Ideathon)

1. Complete MVP with working ROSCA smart contract
2. AI scheduler and fraud scoring agent
3. Launch pilot in real-world community
4. Token-based incentive layer (HODL reward)
5. Mobile-first UI with Internet Identity integration
